    "2. To some extent, it will be very frustrating if we throw the problem to the chatbot without any explanations or notation. It was specially demonstrated when I was doing the Monte Hall problem. The codes of the Monte Hall problem initially provided by Prof were hard to understand under a poor Python foundation. However, if we ask the chatbot to make it less complicated, the Chatbot would simplify the codes by using the codes you would learn in the first three weeks of CSC108. \n",
